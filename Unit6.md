## 6.1 Accumulation of Change
- Area Under the Curve
    - Area between the function and x-axis
    - Area above the x-axis is considered +ve
    - Area below the x-axis is considered -ve
    - 🎦 F6.1.1.PNG
- Area under the curve for a "Rate of change" function is called "Accumulation of change"
    - How to find units for "Area under the curve"
        - Multiply units on y-axis with x-axis and simplify by cutting out the common units
