- Intermediate Value Theorem(IVT)
    - Unit 1
    - Function needs to be continuous
    - Value of function at point "a" is f(a)
    - Value of function at point "b" is f(b)
    - Then all values between "f(a)" and "f(b)" are guaranteed to be present between "a" and "b"

- Average Rate of Change
    - Slope
    - f(b)-f(a)/b-a
- Mean Value Theorem(MVT)
    - Unit 5
    - f'(c)= f(b)-f(a)/b-a
    - In interval "a" to "b", it is guaranteed to have a point where derivation of the function will equal to the average rate of change
- Average Value of a function

    - It is the height of the rectangle with base as "a" and "b", such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve in interval "a" to "b"
