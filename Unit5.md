# Unit 5 - Analytical Application of Differentiation

## MVT - Mean Value Theorem
- 2nd existance theorem
    - Condition 1: f(x) should be continious in closed interval [a,b] i.e pictorically no holes, jumps e.t.c
    - Condition 2: f(x) should be differentiable in open interval (a,b) i.e pictorically no cusps
    - There exists a point c between a and b, where instantaneous rate of change = Average rate of change i.e pictorically Slope of (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) =  Slope of f'(x)
    - Average rate of change = f(b) - f(a) / b - a

> [Q1] Use the function f (x) = —x² + 3x + 10 to answer the following.
> a. On the interval [2, 6], what is the average rate of change?
> b. On the interval (2, 6), when does the instantaneous rate of change equal the average rate of change?

## IVT - Intermediate Value Theorem
- 1st existance theorem
    - Condition 1: f(x) should be continious in closed interval [a,b] i.e pictorically no holes, jumps e.t.c
    - For a given interval [a, b] the y values at endpoints will be f(a) and f(b)
    - IVT gaurtees that any value of y that lies between f(a) and f(b) will always exist atleast once on the fuction within the interval [a, b]

> [Q2]
> q2.png
> a) Yes, since the function is twice diffentiable, it must be continous. So, the IVT applies: since h(5)=40 and h(15)=70, there must be a time c within interval [5, 15] such that h(c)=50
> b) IVT doesn't apply as v(20)=2 and v(30)=4 and 1.5 doesn't lie within this interval
> Avg rate of change = h(30)-h(20)/(30-20) = (80-65)/10 = 15/10 = 1.5
> Since the funtion h(t) is diffentiable, it must be continous. The MVT applies and there must be some value c in interval [20,30] such that f'(c) = 1.5

## EVT - Extreme Value Theorem
   - Condition 1: f(x) should be continious in closed interval [a,b] i.e pictorically no holes, jumps e.t.c
   - EVT gaurantees that f has alease one minimum value and at least on maximum value on [a, b]

## Extrema
- Global aka Absolute: Overall largest or smallest
- Local aka Relative: Largest or smallest in a "local area"

> [Q4]
> Find all extreme values. Identify the type and where they occur.
> q4.png
> Absolute minima of 1 at x=-3
> Absolute maxima of 5 at x=0
> Releative minima of 2 at x=1

> [Q5]
> Find all extreme values. Identify the type and where they occur.
> q5.png
> Absolute maxima of 3 at x=-1
> Relative maxima of 1 at x=1
> Maybe a relative minima of -1 at x=4

## Critical Point
- A point that has a possibility of being an extrema
- cp.png
- How to find Critical Point
    - f'(x) is 0
    - f'(x) is undefined
- Critical point must be in the domain of function, so the fuction should have a valid value at that point

> [Q5]
> Find all critical points
> f(x)= 1/3 x³ - 9x + 24

> [Q6]
> Find all critical points
> g(x) = 1 / sqrt(4-x²)
